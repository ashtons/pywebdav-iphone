PyWebDAV is a standards compliant WebDAV server and library written in Python


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Python WebDAV implementation (level 1 and 2) that features a library that enables you
to integrate WebDAV server capabilities to your application

A fully working example on how to use the library is included. You can find the server in the DAVServer package. Upon installation a script called davserver is created in your $PYTHON/bin directory.

If you search an easy to use WebDAV server that supports most clients (cadaver, Mac OS X Finder, Windows Explorer, ...) then try out PyWebDAV.


INSTALLATION
------------

Installation and setup of server can be as easy as follows:

$ easy_install PyWebDAV 
$ davserver -D /tmp -n -J

If you're living on the bleeding edge then check out the sourcecode from
http://code.google.com/p/pywebdav/source/checkout

After having downloaded code simply install a development egg:

$ svn co svn checkout http://pywebdav.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pywebdav
$ cd pywebdav
$ python setup.py develop
$ davserver --help

Send patches to http://code.google.com/p/pywebdav/issues/list

If you want to use the library then have a look at the DAVServer package that
holds all code for a full blown server. Also doc/ARCHITECURE has information for you.
